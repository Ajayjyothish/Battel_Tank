# Battle_Tank
Open world head to head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and UE4 control systems

## Concept:
Battle Tank is a 3D tank simulator that pits the player versus another player or a computer controlled AI. The players engage across an open, simulated terrain featuring hills, valleys, and possibly vegetation, rivers, or wetlands. The landscape might also feature land mines or mortars to add to the challenge.
